              <h1>Introduction</h1>
              <p>Hello! My name is Chiaen Fu and I go by Peter. I was born in Taiwan and spent all my childhood in there. At sixteen years old, I had a chance to move to Denver, CO with my family. This decision had totally changed my life as being an immature teenager at that time.</p>
              <p>When I first came to US, I had some very difficult time to catch up all the class materials compared to the kids at my age. I honestly can not remember how many times I misunderstood other people's meaning and caused many embarrassing moments at school. However, I had never give up and eventually passed all my high school classes and became a college student.</p>
              <p>During my college life, I always had dream to become a digital artist to design either animation, 3D model, comic, fashion or even video game so I spent pretty much all the time to acquire all the knowledge related to Adobe suites, video editing and some basic web knowledge. That was the most exciting time in my life so far.</p>
              <p>After I got my bechlor degree, I did a few design jobs but most of them did not last very long time unless I knew how to make them to work with website. From that time, I realized it was a "must" to know how to code if I wanted to find a better job. Therefore, I self-taught most of my front-end knowledge for the past few years while looked for better company to work for.</p>
              <p>Besides working, I like to play phone games, work out at gym, play piano, invest money, learn how to cook and find the best restaurants around me. Due to I am different than the majority people in Denver, I also like to explore new things or even try something I have never done before. It is my pleasure to meet you all!</p>
