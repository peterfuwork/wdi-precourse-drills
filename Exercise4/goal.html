              <h1>Goal</h1>
              <p>I had a few years experience in the front-end development world. I know how to build stylish web pages and some dynamic contents. I did pretty well in my previous position and had built some nice projects. However, the technology is changing every moment and I must to keep learning in order to become a confident employee in the industry. This is my primary intension to apply galvanize school. Also, I realized it is very important to understand how the entire web ecosystem works from design to front-end and from front-end to back-end. In my previous job, I always run into some kind of communication issue due to each department lack of specialist who understanding how the entire technology works together, these issues include graphic designers ask me how to design responsive template, I could not understand all the terminology back-end developers mentioned in the meeting, and my supervisor always told me to learn bunch of new things I have no clue where do they all came from.</p>
              <p>I decide to become a full stack developer in order to have more opportunities in the job market. Finding job can be a crucial process and if I am expect to get a decent job with nice salary, it can be even harder. I know Galvanize has very powerful social network that relates to web development so I hope I can find a better job right after I graduate from here.</p>
              <p>Beside working as web developer, my ultimate dream is to become a professional digital artist who is able to create comic or story for movie or video game. I know dream is a dream but I know it does not produce steady income so I will hold on to a day I no longer have to worry about the money. As for now, I have to come out with some realistic plan get a better job to support myself.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I want to say I just can not wait to start my journey in Galvanize. Hoping this up coming six months will change my career title and become a popular super star in my future company.</p>
